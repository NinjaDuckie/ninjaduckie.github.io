Within half a year I was working in their technical team, delivering hardware solutions for court and arbitration transcriptions, and helping to pioneer the prototype of their now flagship product, Magnum, a platform for hosting evidence, arguments, transcripts, team communication, and whatever else was needed for such legal proceedings.</p>\n<p>In the five years that followed I spearheaded the opening of their Singapore office by training new staff on-site in the Singapore supreme court, and provided live technical assistance at private arbitrations around the world, including Osaka, Miami, Geneva, the Hague, and even St. Vincent &amp; the Grenadines.</p>\n<p>When I was not globetrotting or working in the local courts, I provided internal IT support, assisted with the production and delivery of printed and digital transcripts, produced 3D-modeled marketing videos to demonstrate and sell new product solutions, and kept morale up running after-hours tabletop games nights midweek.</p>\n<p>I departed Opus 2 in 2017.</p>",
